# Releasing

There is no registry and no `npm publish`: `package.json` is `private: true`, and a consumer installs this package as a git dependency. **The tag is the release** — pinning to a tag, rather than to a branch or to a bare commit SHA, is the packaging model, and README, "How the hub and the console consume it", is where it is written down.

That model is not yet in force, and nothing below should be read as saying it already is. `v0.1.0` is tagged, and no consumer pins a tag: `kodera-console` and `kodera-landing` declare the dependency, and each pins a bare commit SHA on its `main`. `samourai-hub` does not depend on the package at all yet; its README says the v2 repaint "waits on that package being published".

Everything below exists so that a tag is reproducible by whoever cuts one, and so that nothing reaches a consumer that was not proven on `main` first. Where a step says "since the previous tag", or says to repin, it describes the steady state that the first tag creates rather than one it inherits; each such step says what the first time through does instead.

## Before the tag

All of this is checked on `main`, at the commit that will carry the tag. A release branch is never tagged.

1. **`npm test` is green on `main`.** The `ci-ok` check on the merge commit, and a local run on a fresh checkout of that commit. Local matters because CI does not run `npm run build`: the drift gate asserts the committed `dist/` equals a fresh build, and building first would make that assertion vacuous.
2. **`dist/` is regenerated and drift-clean.** `npm run build && git status --porcelain` prints nothing. A tag whose `dist/` lags `tokens.json` installs the old palette in every repository that pins it, with no error anywhere.
3. **The contrast register has been read**, not just run. `npm run check:contrast` prints the table; every `ALLOWED` and `EXEMPT` row in `contrast-known-failures.json` carries a reason and the decision it records. A row still "awaiting" a decision is a reason not to tag, because the tag freezes it into what consumers ship.
4. **The decider is named.** Every pull request since the previous tag that changes what a consumer renders has the person who decided it named in the pull request's description or in the release's CHANGELOG entry. The trigger is the generated output, not the file edited: a value in `tokens.json`, and equally a design constant the build emits into `dist/`. Those constants live in `scripts/lib/spec.mjs`, in the exported `SPEC` object — two entries today, `pageGradient` and `focusRing`, the second emitted per ring variant as a two-tone `--focus-ring…` custom property and its indicator `--focus-ring…-color` companion, declared inside every theme block, and in the preset as `ringWidth.DEFAULT` and one `ringColor` key per variant. `scripts/build.mjs` imports `SPEC` and declares no design value of its own; what it does hold is naming and defaulting policy, which step 5 classes as a rename rather than a value change. **The two files to read are therefore `tokens.json` and `scripts/lib/spec.mjs`**, and `git log <previous tag>..main -- tokens.json scripts/lib/spec.mjs` is the list of pull requests this step is about — for the first tag, the whole history. Naming the two `SPEC` entries is an illustration and not a list: the rule is written against the output, so a constant added to `SPEC` is covered on the day it lands (ADR-0002, points 2 and 3, which also require every colour `SPEC` composes to carry a row in `contrast-pairs.json`). A token value change is a design decision (AGENTS.md, "The source of truth"), and a build constant that reaches `dist/` is one on the same footing: a consumer cannot tell which file a rendered value came from, and a tag that carries either unsigned ships a value nobody chose. No name, no tag.
5. **The version is right.** `package.json` `version` follows console ADR-0004 and DESIGN_HANDOFF F5, read against what the build emits rather than against `tokens.json` alone: renaming or removing a name a consumer can use — a token, a CSS variable, a preset key — is a **major**; a deprecation keeps the old name resolving for one minor; a value change alone, in `tokens.json` or in a design constant the build emits, is a minor. The `Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md` becomes the heading for this version in the same pull request as the bump.

## The tag

Annotated, on `main`, pushed on its own:

```sh
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
npm test && npm run build && git status --porcelain   # green, and prints nothing
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "design-tokens vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The tag name is `v` + the `package.json` version, exactly. A tag is never moved or deleted once pushed: a consumer pinned to it has already resolved it, and a moved tag is the drift ADR-0004 exists to prevent. A mistaken tag is followed by a corrected patch tag, and the changelog says so.

The person cutting the tag is one of the maintainers in `CODEOWNERS`.

## After the tag

The tag changes nothing until a consumer pins it. One pull request per consuming repository, opened by whoever cut the tag:

- Each repository that declares the dependency — `kodera-console` and `kodera-landing` — bumps `"@samourai/design-tokens": "github:samouraiworld/kodera-design-tokens#vX.Y.Z"` in `package.json` and refreshes its lockfile. For the first tag the bump replaces a commit SHA rather than an earlier tag. `samourai-hub` is expected to join when its v2 repaint lands — its README says the repaint waits on this package being published — and it takes the same pull request on the day it declares the dependency; until then there is nothing in it to repin, so no pull request is opened against it.
- The consuming repository's CI runs the token-resolution guard against the new preset; a class that no longer resolves fails there, which is the point of pinning rather than tracking a branch. The console imports that guard from this package, as `@samourai/design-tokens/token-test`.
- The repin pull request pastes the `check:contrast` rows whose ratio moved since the previous pin — for the first tag, since the commit SHA the console pins now — so the reviewer sees what a value change does to the screens before the palette lands on them.
- The consumer's version-drift rule (README, "The version-drift rule for consumers") is what makes the repin happen once there is a run of tags to fall behind: a consumer more than one minor behind the newest tag fails its own CI. It has no baseline to measure against until a second tag exists, and no consumer implements the check today.
